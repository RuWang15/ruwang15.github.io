intro:
  title: Hello!
  body: >
    I'm a ~~first~~ second year Master student in CS at UC San Diego.
    My interests lie at the intersection of **HCI** and **mobile computing**. Specifically, I want to design new interactions to facilitate people's daily tasks, and enable an effective collaboration. I also want to explore mental health intervention in my future research. <br><br>
    I will be applying to fall 2021 PhD programs this year. Please click [***here***](/pdfs/RW_CV_10012020.pdf) to view my CV.
