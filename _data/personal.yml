intro:
  title: Hello!
  body: >
    I'm a ~~first~~ second year Master student in CS at UC San Diego.
    My interests lie in **HCI** and **ubiquitous computing**. Specifically, I want to design and build novel interactive systems to assist people with their daily tasks, and enable effective collaborations. I'm also interested in democratizing mental health care. <br><br>
    I will be applying to fall 2021 PhD programs this year. Please click [***here***](/pdfs/RW_CV_11012020.pdf) to view my CV.
  #I will be applying for PhD/master's programs on HCI, 2019 Fall. Please click *here*.
