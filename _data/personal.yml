  # title: Hello!
  body: >
    I'm a 4th year CS PhD candidate at University of Wisconsin-Madison. I'm currently working with Prof. [Yuhang Zhao](https://www.yuhangz.com). 
    My research interests include **Human-Computer Interaction, Eye Tracking, Extended Reality, Accessibility, and Mental Health**. 
    I design and build intent-aware interactive systems to (1) enhance accessibility of visual information, and (2) provide personalized in-situ mental health support.
    <br> <br>
    
    Before Madison, I received my MS from UCSD where I worked with Prof. [Nadir Weibel](https://hxi.ucsd.edu/author/nadir-weibel/) and Prof. [Xinyu Zhang](http://xyzhang.ucsd.edu/). 
    Prior to UCSD, I received my BS from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
