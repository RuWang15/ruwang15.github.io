intro:
  title: Hello!
  body: >
    I'm a ~~first~~ second year MSCS student at UC San Diego. I'm currently working with Prof. [Nadir Weibel](https://www.ubicomp.ucsd.edu/weibel) and Prof. [Xinyu Zhang](http://xyzhang.ucsd.edu/). 
    Prior to UCSD, I received my B.S. at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. <br> <br>
    My research interests lie in **HCI** and **Ubiquitous Computing**. Specifically, I want to design and build interactive systems to improve people's productivity and mental well-being through novel sensing technologies and personalized feedback.<br><br>
  #I will be applying for PhD/master's programs on HCI, 2019 Fall. Please click *here*.
  #[*here*](/pdfs/ruwang_cv_20181122.pdf) to see my CV.
  #I also want to explore mental health intervention in my future research.
  #I also worked with Prof. [Cheng Zhang](http://www.czhang.org/) at Cornell in 2018.<br> <br>
