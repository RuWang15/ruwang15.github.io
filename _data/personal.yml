intro:
  title: Hello!
  body: >
    I'm a 3rd year PhD student at University of Wisconsin-Madison. I'm currently working with Prof. [Yuhang Zhao](https://www.yuhangz.com). 
    My research interests include **Human-Computer Interaction, Accessibility, Mental Health, and AR/VR Technology**. 
    I'm interested in designing real-time intention-aware interventions to improve people's productivity and mental well-being. <br> <br>
    
    Before Madison, I received my MS from UCSD where I worked with Prof. [Nadir Weibel](https://hxi.ucsd.edu/author/nadir-weibel/) and Prof. [Xinyu Zhang](http://xyzhang.ucsd.edu/). 
    Prior to UCSD, I received my BS from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 
    

  #I will be applying for PhD/master's programs on HCI, 2019 Fall. Please click *here*.
  #[*here*](/pdfs/ruwang_cv_20181122.pdf) to see my CV.
  #I also want to explore mental health intervention in my future research.
  #I also worked with Prof. [Cheng Zhang](http://www.czhang.org/) at Cornell in 2018.<br> <br>
