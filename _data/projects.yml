  name: 'ThumbTrak (On Going)'
  location: Cornell University
  advisor: Cheng Zhang
  description: >
    ThumbTrak is a continuous one-handed thumb-on-fingers input technology.
    It allows the user to use the thumb to continuously input on fingers by tracking the position of the thumb using wearable motion sensing. It consists of a thumb-ring and a wristband.
    With ThumbTrak, a user is able to input on applications in one-hand, which demands continuously input capability, such as drawing and text entry applications.

  name: 'Approximate Random Dropout for DNN training acceleration in GPGPU'
  location: Shanghai Jiao Tong University
  advisor: Li Jiang
  description: >
    The training phases of DNN consumes enormous processing time and energy, and conventional compression techniques can hardly be used in the training phase.
    We propose the Approximate Random Dropout to eliminate the unnecessary computation and data access. To compensate the performance loss we develop a SGD-based Search Algorithm to produce the distribution of dropout patterns.

  name: 'Virtual Dressing System'
  location: Shanghai Jiao Tong University
  advisor: Weiyao Lin
  description: >
    This system is based on a RGBD camera (Kinect V2) and OpenPose.
    We use Kinect SDK to retrieve 3D human pose and refine the 3D skeleton with 2D pose estimation obtained by OpenPose, and reproject the refined 2D skeleton back to 3D space using depth information.
    This system can let user select clothes and try them on. The size of the clothes can be changed automatically according to the user's body shape.

  name: 'RGBD-based Single Person 3D Pose Estimation (On Going)'
  location: Shanghai Jiao Tong University
  advisor: Weiyao Lin
  description: >
    This work is to estimate 3D human pose directly from RGB and depth images obtained by Kinect V2.
    We first utilize a state-of-the-art 2D pose estimator to get 2D keypoints heatmaps and tile them along z-dimention. At the same time we voxelize the depth image.
    Then the two features are combined together and fed into a Encoder-Decoder network to produce the 3D keypoints.

  name: 'Driving Cognitive Workload Analysis based on RNN'
  location: Shanghai Jiao Tong University
  advisor: Na Ruan
  description: >
    This work is to estimate driver's cognitive workload while driving.
    We use physiological data and driver's self-ratings while driving to generate ground truth and build a RNN-based realtime estimation system using only vehicle data such as acceleration and speed.
