I"é<p>GrandpARents is an AR-based system on HoloLens that helps elderly people with visual and/or hearing impairments to cope with their daily tasks. There are two main features in our system. The first one is real-time subtitle for one-on-one conversations. The subtitle will be automatically generated in front of the user when someone is talking;  the second feature is Zoom, which allows the user to magnify an area of interest by simply taking a picture and resize it with gestures.</p>
