I"À<p>We built a closed-loop system that aims to mitigate the userâ€™s cognitive+visual workload level when performing daily tasks, such as paper reading and arithmetic problem solving.  We measure the userâ€™s workload by EEG signal collected from Muse (a commercial EEG headset). Workload levels are defined by N-back tasks and we use a deep learning model for classification.  We designed different mitigation strategies for different tasksâ€¦</p>
